## Project Overview

This project was done as the capstone to a Distributed Intelligents in Multi-Robot Systems independent study course. 

The goal of this project was to suplement the ROS SLAM package with the ability to fuse particle swarms with other robots within line of sight. My job in the project was to use OpenCV to determine the relative positioning between robots in the arena. I did this by placing 4 Aruco markers on top of each robot. I was then able to translate from the position of the Aruco marker to the position of the robot.
