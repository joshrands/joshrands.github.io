## Project Overview

This project was done during the Hacking 4 Defense program at Colorado School of Mines. This was a graduate level elective course that lasted the spring semester. Students were given a sponsor organization (ours was the US Fish & Wildlife Service) and a problem. The rest of the semester was spent coming up with a solution! 

Throughout the semester my team designed and built an email search warrant analytics tool to aid US Fish & Wildlife Service Special Agents in finding incriminating emails in email search warrant data sets. Special agents in remote districts do not have the budget to afford advanced search warrant processing tools. Because of this, they are forced to manually search through Gigabytes of email datasets. We created a tool to automatically parse these datasets and display insightful metrics, saving agents hours of time manually scrolling through emails as well as thousands of dollars.
