# Chess101

Role: System Architecture & Sensor Integration

Duration: March 2018 - May 2018

Code: [Chess101](https://github.com/joshrands/Chess101)

# Project Overview

Chess101 was done as a final project for a python-based computing course I took Sophomore year of college. The goal was to create a chessboard that would light up valid moves when you picked up a piece. We ended up taking it a step further and allowing you to play against an AI. The AI would light up which piece it wanted to move, and then the location it wanted to move it.

My role in the project was getting sensor data and building the board state. Each chess piece had a magnet in the bottom, and each location on the chessboard had a reed switch. This allowed us to capture the location of each piece, and keep track of them as they moved.

To efficiently capture the board state, I used 8 slave Arduinos connected to a master Raspberry Pi through I2C. Each Arduino would sample the state of an entire row of 8 reed switches. The status was then encoded into an 8 bit integer and sent to the Raspberry Pi over I2C. The Raspberry Pi would compile the state of every reed switch from the Arduinos and have the current board state.

I was then able to call on the Python chess library built by my peers to get a list of valid moves for a given piece. I would take this information and light up a 4x4 array of LEDs in a 64x64 LED matrix. This matrix was underneath the 3D printed chess frame that had 64 channels to direct the 8x8 LED arrays of light to a thin cover on the top.

Overall this project was a massive success, and super fun! We demonstrated at the CSM Computation Fair and had many students play against the AI.
