# The Litter CleanUp App

In May of 2020, I had the idea to make a crowd-sourced litter cleanup app. One month later I had taught myself how to develop full stack mobile apps using Google's Flutter app framework and Firebase backend. About 4 months later the Litter CleanUp app was live on the app store!

The app now has over 300 users who have collectively picked up over 15,000 pieces of litter.
