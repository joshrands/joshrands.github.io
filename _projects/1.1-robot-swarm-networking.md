## Project Overview

I invented a network monitoring algorithm that reduces bandwidth by predicting network metrics between mobile nodes. Robot swarms often have to operate in dynamic environments with limited onboard resources. Unnecessary network communication is costly both in consuming network bandwidth and battery power. My novel network monitoring algorithm uses historical data to predict future data when possible, cutting network monitoring overhead by 50% with no loss in network performance.

The second phase of the project involved building a physical testbed. The goal was to take an off the shelf ad-hoc routing algorithm (AODV) and adapt it to use network monitoring information from REM. The routing would be performed on Raspberry Pis mounted to drones. We were able to successful perform multi-hoc adhoc routing using multiple Raspberry Pis. Unfortunately we never ran the project on the full drone swarm testbed as our time was cut short because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
