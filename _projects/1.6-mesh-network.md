# Embedded Mesh Network

This project was done as the capstone for a Microcomputer Architecture course. The goal was to use wireless Xbee radios to create a mesh network to communicate GPS and IMU data to a base station.

The following image shows the Level-0 system description of the real time sensor mesh network node. The system consisted of a PIC18F26K22 microcontroller, an IMU/temperature sensor, GPS, and Xbee radio. The IMU communicated with the PIC through I2C, while the GPS and Xbee used EUSART.
